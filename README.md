Student Management system is a Java Swing framework based Desktop application.
this was my first java Desktop application prject when i take Java SE(Standard Edition)
course in BUET(Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology) under IAC(Information Access Center).
this application is very user friendly and store large number of student information 
of every department in univerysity. i use "XAMPP" server and MySql Data Base without using 
"SQlite". so you need a XAMPP server. i already give my Data Base SQl file under the 
project folder. 
<br>
just need to create a Data Base and give name it "student". then import two SQl file "admin"
and "student". "student" table contains the student data and "admin" table contains the admin 
data for accessing and veryfing valid admin user to access student data base.
